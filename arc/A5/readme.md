### JSON data chosen
In this section, mention which of the four JSON data sets you chose to use in your web page.

> data-restaurant.js

### Brief description of web page developed (~150 words)
Describe your web page here. In your description, focus on how it works - and what the TA should do to test your web page's functionality. If you had to make any assumptions, write your assumptions here as well (if it goes over 150 words, it is okay).

> This is a website created around the restaurant data given to me for the assignment. I've created a restaurant-vibe website with the asked feature of creating a search form and showing the data related to the search. In this case, the user would search a dish, and the table will show all the matching dishes and their descriptions <br><br> To test the website, please first refer to the data-restaurant.js file located in the js folder. Then, type in any dishes you've seen in the js data file into the website's search bar. The website, after clicking the search button, should output the list of data (if it exists) on the simple table.
<br><br> In my custom script, I've created three functions: searchMenu, deleteTable, and updateTable. The main function is the searchMenu() function, where it compares the characters in the search box to the array of object data. If it matches, then it is pushed into an array. After resetting the table using deleteTable, the updateTable function will update the table with freshly updated array.
