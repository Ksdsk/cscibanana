                If you could make the how-to-play appear and disappear on CLICK, that would be great (JS required) -->
            <div id="how-to-play">
                <p>The basic rules of the game are very simple: you are presented with five questions that come from a range of diiferent topics, your job is to try and answer each question. If your answer is correct then the answer zone will turn green but if your answer is wrong then your answer zone will turn red. If you answer all the questions then you've beat the game and something special might happen *wink wink*.</p>
                <p>If all your answers are correct you will also be crowned as our <em>Trivia King or Queen</em> and have your name written in our Hall of Fame</p>
